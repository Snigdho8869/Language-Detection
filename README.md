# Language-DetectionLanguage Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This repository contains code and resources for a language detection project based on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. The project aims to identify 18 different languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, Bengali and more.

# Requirements:

* Python

* Scikit-learn

* TensorFlow

* Keras
 
* nltk

# Dataset:

The language detection models were trained on a dataset of text samples from various sources, such as Wikipedia articles, news articles, and social media posts. 

# Webapplication:

This web application for language detection using machine learning and deep learning would allow users to input text data and receive a prediction for that text.

# Webapplication Interface:
